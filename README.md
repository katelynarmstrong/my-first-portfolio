# my-first-portfolio

## Description
For this project I built my first portfolio to show off the projects that i have created and the skills that I have learned. 
I used html to ensure that my nav bar links work so that when clicked the page jumps down to the corresponding section as well as loads my resume when resume is clicking in nav bar. I created tiled images and used CSS styling so that when overing over the images it enlarges while using html to ensure when the image in my works is clicked, the user is taken to the deployed site for corresponding to the image via a new tab. In the contact me section I used html so that when the user clicks my email, it opens in their mail app to start typing an email to contact me. I also used flex styling to ensure that my portfolio is easy to use on different screen sizes.
